Change log:
1. Updated web.xml to include version information to resolve 404 error
2. Updated pom.xml to add jackson-databind dependency, for automatic conversion of json to CakeEntity object 
3. updated index.jsp to forward the request to /cakes(servlet mapping). This technique is used to implement first requirement 
   of the project. The requirement is as follows.
   * By accessing the root of the server (/) it should be possible to list the cakes currently in the system.  This
   must be presented in an acceptable format for a human to read.
4. Updated CakceServlet.java init method to parse the json string(from URL provided) and get list of CakeEntity objects using 
   jackson databind api. CakeEntity properties have been re-factored to hold right attributes.
5. Created cakelisting.jsp that lists Cakes in human readable format.
6. Created addItem.jsp page that uses jquery ajax request to add cake to server. Included this page in cakelisting.jsp.
   5&6 takes care of first and second requirements of the project.
7. Updated CakeServlet to remove duplicate entries(cake with same titles) from listing for optimized reporting.
8. Enhanced CakeServlet doGet method to handle requests for browser based and client based to download json. This covers the  
   requirement 3 & 4.
9. CakeServlet doGet method forwards the request to cakelisting.jsp which in turn contain addItem.jsp. This covers fifth 
   requirement.
10. CakeServlet.doPost method takes care of adding new cake request. Added addCake method in CakeServlet that reports 
    duplicate entry errors as alerts.   
11. basic validations have been taken care for adding a new cake.
12. Improved exception handling to propagate messages that are useful to user. (like duplicate cake entry)
13. Added close method to HibernateUtil class for effective closing of resources.
14. Please ignore Cake.java, CakeStore.java classes as they have been created for initial testing purposes.
15. Tested the program with a Rest client and verified that http://localhost:8282/cakes returns a downloadable json object.

UI is kept simple catering to given requirements.
Logging and Exception handling can be improved further. But considering the time limits, I have enhanced the code as per above mentioned change log. 

Tested in firefox 52.7.0, Chrome Version 70.0 and IE 11
